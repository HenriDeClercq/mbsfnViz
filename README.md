# Visualizing the adaptive mbsfn solution

In the CLIENTSIDE directory, a modified mac directory can be found. When replacing the original mac file from the adaptive mbsfn solution, 
the client will now send the parameters to a socket as well as print them on the terminal as before. 
For more details, go to "CLIENTSIDE/adaptive_mbsfn/README.docx".

In the SERVERSIDE directory, two data visualizing tools can be found. The main goals of the two tools is to be able to visualize the adaptive parameters as well as store
them. A simple version only using Python en matplotlib is found the MatplotViz directory. The second, more mature tool called ThingsViz can be found in the ThingsViz 
directory. 
For more details, go to "SERVERSIDE/MatplotViz/README.docx",
                        "SERVERSIDE/ThingsViz/README.docx".
